## Lordchancellor's Documentation of Project 7
                                 Summary: 
- In [Project 6](https://www.darey.io/docs/project-6-step-1/), I implemented a WordPress based solution that is ready to be filled with content and can be used as a full fledged website or blog. (please check [Project 6 Documentation](https://github.com/Lordchancellorr/project-6) to access the documentation). However, this project is about the deployment of Devops Tools like [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Jrog Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/), [Rancher](https://rancher.com/products/rancher/), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana) responsible for the day to day activities in managing, developing, testing, deploying and monitoring different projects. Read below to see how it was done!
## implementation of Instructions in Project 7
- Step 1
New Instances were launched in this order: 4 instances were spinned up usinf Redhat(For 3 Webservers and the NFS) while the last instance spinned up was Ubuntu 20.04 for the Database server. See the Image below:![Instances](). Just as i did in project6, the Logical volumes were configured. See the Images below for significant output:
![Attached Volumes]() ![First partition]()  ![Logical Volumes]()  Mount Points were created and named: `lv-apps`(mounted on `/mnt/apps` - to be used by the webservers), `lv-logs`(mounted on `/mnt/logs` to be used by webservers logs) and `lv-opt` (mounted on `/mnt/opt` for Jenkins in Project 8) respectively. 
- NFS was set up and enabled with these codes: `sudo yum -y update`, `sudo yum install nfs-utils -y`, `sudo systemctl start nfs-server.service`, `sudo systemctl enable nfs-server.service`and `sudo systemctl status nfs-server.service` to check the status. See the image below to see the output. ![NFS status]()
